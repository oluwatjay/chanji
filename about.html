            <p><span class="bigC">C</span>hanja Datti is a social enterprise that currently collects waste plastic (PET bottles, pure water sachet, nylon bags etc.) and other recyclables like aluminium cans, papers (old newspapers, cardboard, cartons, old textbooks etc.), tires, and glass bottles, and transforms them into flakes or shreds, as raw materials in the manufacture of other products. . Chanja Datti is committed to environmental protection and is strategically poised to deploy indigenous technology including those produced by students from Nigeria’s tertiary institutions towards its recycling efforts.
            </p>
            <p>The goal of the enterprise is to clean up the Abuja environment by transforming its waste to value. We plan to reduce the effects of combustion and landfill methods of waste management that lead to the release of greenhouse and other toxic gases into the atmosphere; eradicate extreme poverty and hunger by empowering youth and women micro-entrepreneurs; reduce flooding caused by clogging of waterways by plastic; sensitize and raise awareness about waste sorting and recycling and combat the breeding of disease causing microorganisms from stagnant water through our ‘live clean’ program.
